        <p style="color: white; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">
            Dear Far Eastern University Community,
        </p>
        <p style="color: white; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">
            In light of the recent weather forecast indicating a significant rise in the heat index, we have made the decision to suspend all classes and academic activities on May 10, 2024. The safety and well-being of our students, faculty, and staff remain our utmost priority, and this precautionary measure aims to ensure everyone's health and comfort during this period of extreme weather conditions.
        </p>
        <p style="color: white; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">
            While we understand the importance of maintaining the academic calendar, we believe that this temporary suspension is necessary to mitigate the risks associated with prolonged exposure to high temperatures. We encourage everyone to stay hydrated, avoid unnecessary outdoor activities, and take necessary precautions to prevent heat-related illnesses. Additionally, please monitor official university channels for any further updates or announcements regarding class schedules and campus operations.
        </p>
        <p style="color: white; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">
            We appreciate your understanding and cooperation during this time. Let us all prioritize our health and safety as we navigate through this heatwave together. Stay cool, stay safe, and we look forward to welcoming you back to campus under more favorable weather conditions.
        </p>
